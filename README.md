Data Wrangling and Exploration (data_wrangling_exploration.Rmd)

1. Filtering:
Removes genes with low expression and samples with low read counts.
2. Merging:
Combines count data with sample information.
3. Gene Selection:
Extracts protein-coding genes, lncRNAs, and pseudogenes.
4. File Output:
Writes the filtered count data to a file.
5. Gene Annotation:
Connects to Ensembl BioMart for bovine genes.
6. Annotation File:
Writes gene annotation data to files.
These steps collectively contribute to a well-curated and annotated dataset, laying the foundation for further exploration and analysis of biological insights.
