## Data Wrangling and Exploration (data_wrangling_exploration.Rmd)

1. Filtering:
Removes genes with low expression and samples with low read counts.
2. Merging:
Combines count data with sample information.
3. Gene Selection:
Extracts protein-coding genes, lncRNAs, and pseudogenes.
4. File Output:
Writes the filtered count data to a file.
5. Gene Annotation:
Connects to Ensembl BioMart for bovine genes.
6. Annotation File:
Writes gene annotation data to files.
These steps collectively contribute to a well-curated and annotated dataset, laying the foundation for further exploration and analysis of biological insights.

## Summary statistics of read counts (read_counts_summary.Rmd)

Loads and analyzes the counts.summary files generated by the aligner.
Performs the following steps:
1. Load the counts.summary files.
2. Calculate the number of reads sequenced per sample.
3. Identify samples with low read counts
4. Calculate the mean and variance of the percentage of reads assigned, unassigned, and discarded across samples.
5. Generate summary plots showing the distribution of reads across samples.

## Count Per Million (CPM) and Fragments Per Kilobase Million (FPKM) Filtering (CPM_FPKM_filter.Rmd)

The CPM_FPKM_filter.Rmd script focuses on determining optimal CPM and FPKM filtering values for a balanced dataset. Its main objectives are:

Gene Count Optimization:
Identifies CPM and FPKM filtering thresholds to ensure a consistent set of around 12,000 genes across at least 9 samples for each age and tissue category.
Minimizing Variance:
Aims to minimize variance between tissues within a given age category, promoting uniformity in gene expression patterns.
Informed Filtering:
Utilizes an educated approach to filtering, considering both the total gene count and inter-tissue variance to strike a balance between dataset size and consistency.
